# [HEARTCARE HUB](https://mikavir.github.io/heartcare-hub)


![screenshot](documentation/mockup.png)


HeartCare Hub is a responsive website that can be viewed and accessed in a wide range of devices. It is aimed towards medical professionals. Under intentions of recruitment, this website will introduce them to the scope of cardiac surgery and the roles and responsibility involved with the practice.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

 Research have shown that most medical websites use blue as the primary theme to promote trust and professionalism[1]. However, I have chosen a set of colours that provide an association to the colours of the heart to correspond with the theme of cardiac surgery. Below are the set of colours chosen to represent the website.

- `#8C0032` used for primary text.
- `#8C0032` used for primary highlights.
- `#3d3035` used for secondary text.
- `#fff` used for secondary highlights.


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/8c0032-e71348-ffffff-666666-333333) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

Research was completed on the preferred typography on a healthcare website. As HeartCare Hub can be referred to as a healthcare website, using similar typography will respect the convention and encourage consistency.

These three fonts were recommended for the use of healthcare websites: [2]

Source Sans pro- sans-serif font
Crimsons text- serif font

The applied use of a combination serif and sans-serif is further recommended in a medical website to provide contrast.

Therefore, these three recommended fonts will be used along with different font-weights used accodingly. Only two fonts will be used as three or more can make teh website appear excessive and lose professionalism [3].

These fonts will be taken from Google Fonts and to be used within my Cascading Style Sheets(CSS).

Icons from Font-Awesome will be used to provide visualisation amongst the text.

- [Source Sans 3](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3?query=source+sans) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Crimson Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Location Cards**

    - In the index page, I have created cards that enable site users to redirect themselves to their desired area of centers. These cards incorporate an interactive zoom hover effect. This feature allows site users to easily find information about where they can work. The cards redirect them to the location page, which displays hospitals in the desired area.

![screenshot](documentation/feature01.png)

- **Information page**

    - When a site user clicks on 'Cardiac Surgery' in the navigation bar, they will be redirected to the information page dedicated to cardiac surgery. This page provides comprehensive navigation, offering detailed information about various aspects of cardiac surgery. This feature allows users interested in cardiac surgery to easily access and gain valuable information about the practice. YouTube videos were also implemented to aid visual and audio learners.

![screenshot](documentation/feature02.png)

- **Call-To-Action**

    - This call-to-action section is located on the index page. It is designed to prompt target audiences to seek more information regarding the practice. The section contains a button with a clear imperative message, 'Find out more.' Additionally, it features an image of a group of smiling healthcare professionals to associate a positive nature with the employment and encourage recruitment.

![screenshot](documentation/feature03.png)

- **Map to the hospitals and contact information**

    - Information about the centers' locations is available on the dedicated location page. You can find the address, contact details, and a hospital image for easy recognition. Additionally, there's an embedded Google Maps feature to enable users to quickly determine the hospital's proximity. This information is valuable for users considering these hospitals for employment, as they can assess accessibility and convenience.

![screenshot](documentation/feature04.png)

- **Contact form**

    - A user-friendly contact form that allows users to share their details and express concerns or questions is implemented in the contact page. This not only fosters a sense of trust but also serves as a relationship-building feature. Furthermore, the provided details can be a valuable connection point, enabling us to keep track of users interested in employment opportunities on the site. Upon submission of the form, a confirmation page is displayed to provide feedback on the successful completion of the submission process.

![screenshot](documentation/feature05.png)

- **Social Media Links**

    - In the footer section, you'll find links to our social media profiles, providing an avenue for enhanced connection with site users and contributing to the establishment of a robust online business presence.

![screenshot](documentation/feature06.png)

- **Logo**

    - The navigation bar features a distinctive and memorable logo â€“ a heart accompanied by the company name, strategically designed to resonate with cardiac surgery. This logo not only ensures clarity but also promotes brand recognition, fostering a stronger connection with our audience.

This addition is poised to enhance user engagement, encouraging repeat visits. Furthermore, these testimonials provide a platform for users to articulate the benefits they've experienced, effectively communicating the value of our website.

- About Us page
    - Introducing an about us page will allow site users to learn more about the organisation fostering trust and credibilility.
