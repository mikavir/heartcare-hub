# [HEARTCARE HUB](https://mikavir.github.io/heartcare-hub)


![screenshot](documentation/mockup.png)


HeartCare Hub is a responsive website that can be viewed and accessed in a wide range of devices. It is aimed towards medical professionals. Under intentions of recruitment, this website will introduce them to the scope of cardiac surgery and the roles and responsibility involved with the practice.

## UX

In this section, you will briefly explain your design processes.

### Colour Scheme

 Research have shown that most medical websites use blue as the primary theme to promote trust and professionalism[1]. However, I have chosen a set of colours that provide an association to the colours of the heart to correspond with the theme of cardiac surgery. Below are the set of colours chosen to represent the website.

- `#8C0032` used for primary text.
- `#8C0032` used for primary highlights.
- `#3d3035` used for secondary text.
- `#fff` used for secondary highlights.


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/8c0032-e71348-ffffff-666666-333333) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

Research was completed on the preferred typography on a healthcare website. As HeartCare Hub can be referred to as a healthcare website, using similar typography will respect the convention and encourage consistency.

These three fonts were recommended for the use of healthcare websites: [2]

Source Sans pro- sans-serif font
Crimsons text- serif font

The applied use of a combination serif and sans-serif is further recommended in a medical website to provide contrast.

Therefore, these three recommended fonts will be used along with different font-weights used accodingly. Only two fonts will be used as three or more can make teh website appear excessive and lose professionalism [3].

These fonts will be taken from Google Fonts and to be used within my Cascading Style Sheets(CSS).

Icons from Font-Awesome will be used to provide visualisation amongst the text.

- [Source Sans 3](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3?query=source+sans) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Crimson Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.
